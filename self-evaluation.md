# Self Evaluation for Arrays

> I feel confident with arrays but I have worked with them before, I would just like to practice the slice and splice methods more to get a better understanding of them.

> I do want to spend more time on each method just to understand them more. 

> I want to complete all of the code challenges and do more research on array methods.

> So far I don't have any questions about arrays but I expect to as time goes on as there are many methods we have not seen yet.
